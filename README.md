* [Glide](https://bumptech.github.io/glide/) to load and cache images by URL.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) for local database storage.
  
It leverages the following components from the Jetpack library:

* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)
* [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
* [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/) with binding adapters
